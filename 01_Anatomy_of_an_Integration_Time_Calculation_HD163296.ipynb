This allows us to use the ``cgi_noise`` instrument model with the various inputs that can be computed by ``EXOSIMS``."

        "Point-source integration time calculations are provided by the `calc_intTime` method of an `EXOSIMS` `OpticalSystem` module (such as ``corgietc``).  This method takes 7 required inputs and one optional one:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An `EXOSIMS` `TargetList` object: this includes all information about the targets (stars) that you might want to observe, along with utilities for computing stellar photometry.  Details on the `TargetList` class are available here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targetlist.html and details on the stellar photometric modeling are available here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#photometry\n",
        "2. The specific subset of targets you wish to compute integration times for (`sInds`).  `TargetList` stores all stellar information in equally-sized arrays, so this input is an array (or list, or other iterable) of which target indices you wish to select.  If your `TargetList` only contains one target, this input would be 0.\n",
        "3. The surface brightness of local zodiacal light to assume for the calculation (`fZ`).  This must be an `astropy` `Quantity` object (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) whose contents are an array of either size 1 (in which case the same value is used for all calculations) or of an equal size to the `sInds` input. The units must be consistent with arcsec$^{-2}$. For details on the local zodiacal light model, see: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#zodiacal-light\n",
        "4. The intensity of the exo-zodiacal light to assume for the calculation (`JEZ`).  This must be structured in the same way as the `fZ` input, but with units consistent with photons s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. For details on the exo-zodiacal light model, see: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#exozodiacal-light\n",
        "5. The desired $\\Delta$magnitude between planet and star you wish to reach (`dMag`).  This must be an iterable of either size 1 (same for all calculations) or of equal size to `sInds`. This value sets the integration depth you wish to achieve.\n",
        "6. The angular separation at which to perform calculations.  Because coronagraph performance varies as a function of angular separation, we must specify where in the throughput/contrast/etc. curves we wish to take our coronagraph performance values from.  That location is specified by this input, which must be an `astropy` `Quantity` array (with the same dimensionality assumptions as the other inputs) with units compatible with arcseconds. For more information on the parametrization of coronagraph performance, see here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opticalsystem.html#standardized-coronagraph-parameters. Note that for the Roman coronagraph, we do **not** parametrize by stellar angular diameter - the assumption is that all of our target stars are fully unresolved.\n",
        "7. The observing mode/scenario (`mode`).  An observing mode is the combination of a specific coronagraph with a specific detector in a specific bandpass.  It also defines the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that you wish to achieve for your observation.  More details here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opticalsystem.html#optical-system-definition\n",
        "8. (Optional) An `EXOSIMS` `TimeKeeping` object.  As the name implies, a `TimeKeeping` object tracks elapsed mission time (amongst other time-associated utilities.  Time-on-orbit is an input into the integration time because we have a degradation model for our detector, which attempts to predict performance changes due to radiation exposure over the length of the mission.  If omitted, ``corgietc`` automatically assumes 21 months at L2. Note that the degradation model implemented by ``cgi_noise`` is only valid out to 63 months - past that, we cannot really trust the results."

So, we pulled the value associated with the our selected observing mode, and then scaled it by the distance to the planet (in AU) squared. One important caveat, the exozodi is scaled not only by the planet's location, but by the assumed inclination of the exo-zodiacal disk (i.e., the exosystem's inclination).
